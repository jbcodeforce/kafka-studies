# Contribution

As well as the [contribution](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guidelines detailed at the top
level of this repo, UI contributions will additionally need to adhere to the following requirements:

- All changes should follow the documented [code style](./CodeStyle.md) for 
the particular type of file being modified or contributed.
- All changes merged to `master` are expected to be complete; no partial 
changes should be contributed.
- Where appropriate, work in a feature branch, and commit little and often. 
Monalithic PRs are near impossible to review throughly!
- Before contributing a change, raise an issue/PR with a README as a proposal
to discuss the change you would like to contribute. This is so we can review
the proposed change/design, and make sure at an early stage that things will
integrate as expected.
- Code should be developed in a TDD/Behavioural manner. Including test plans
or code with an intial discussion issue/PR is highly reccomended!
- Storybook entries are expected for all new code and changes, unless there
is an agreed reason why one cannot be reasonably added
